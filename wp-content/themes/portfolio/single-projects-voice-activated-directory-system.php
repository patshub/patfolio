                While users can benefit from auditory feedback, the amount of information they can retain will be minimal compared to the amount they will remember when visualizing the information. Study shows that people’s ability to remember and identify images they’ve seen before have 83% accuracy. For example, long verbal instructions are less likely to be remembered compared to visual instructions that they can read from.
              </li>
              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Lack of Instructions for Learnability</span>

              </li>
              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Frequent Pauses can Bore Users</span>
                Without immediate feedback to tell users what the system status currently is, not only could users lose some interest and get bored, but it would also consume time more so than how long they planned to invest on interacting with the system.

              While having auditory capabilities can help users with visual disabilities harness information from the system, the lack of visual feedback ignores the other reality that there are users with auditory disabilities or who aren’t technically savvy, which may deem the system inaccessible for those users.

        <p>With the research data we've gathered along the way, we had proposed a solution to our client that promised to generate better results while maintaining our project's scope in tact.
          <br/>Our goal from the beginning was to create an intuitive user experience and robust system. We felt that this solution would be an improvement from what the initial system intended to be,
          because it better reflected what directory systems are at their core, while satisfying what the client wanted to include in the system (which was a voice-recognition feature).
          <br/>We felt confident presenting this solution to Hyuk, and with no time received a "YES!" from him.

                The voice-activated device must be a reliable source of information, free of discoordination or inconsistencies
                in the data being used. The distributed information about room locations or office hours or other department information
                must be highly consistent with what building information the administration has predefined to prevent navigational confusion
                from the user’s perspective.
                <br/>The device must be able to function properly under a variety of conditions, such as a
                traffic of students passing by or any noise that can disrupt the device’s ability to recognize a user’s voice.
                <br/>The device must also be able to perform as expected in a time well-suited for the user. For example, students should not
                have to wait for a long time in order to obtain the information they need from the device - the system should function so that
                students can rely on it providing the information they need in a timely manner.
              </li>
              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Accessibility</span>
                The system must satisfy the needs of all users, not just the ones capable of vocal speech. In a situation
                where a student with a vocal disability needs to use the device to find the location of a room, the system must have
                a way to cater to the disabled user.
                <br/>Furthermore, users who do not speak fluent English must be equally supported.
                With UCI’s diverse community, language barriers must be prevented and the system’s ability to recognize different accents
                or pronunciations must be highly considered.
              </li>

              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Performance</span>
                The voice-activated device must function with a high level of efficiency, enough for users to not experience any delays from the
                interaction. The device must have a short response time following user requests. More specifically, the transmission of data
                within the system (retrieved from a database to the device) must be fast enough to not cause any delays for users.
              </li>

              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Availability</span>
                The voice-activated device must be available to users 100% of the time. When a user approaches the device, the device must be prepared

                The voice-activated device must be able to handle errors that can occur. User errors such as incorrect requests or unfamiliar pronunciations
                must not cause the device to stop functioning properly or cause the system to crash.
                <br/>Environmental factors, such as background noise that can
                disrupt a user’s interaction with the device, must be highly considered and must cause no response error from the system to the user.
                In the event that the system encounters any of the mentioned errors above, the system must respond with the appropriate feedback to guide users
                to move forward and prevent them from being stuck in the error.
              </li>

              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Learnability</span>
                The voice-activated device directory system must be intuitive and must not require too much command-learning and user memory overload.
                With the system’s ability to recognize a variety of vocal commands, users should not have to memorize the commands - instead, the system
                should allow users to ‘speak’ to the device in a casual manner and in many different ways, as if they are inquiring to a real person.
              </li>

              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Memorability</span>
                The voice-activated directory system should have an intuitive and straightforward design so that if a user were to use it once, and return to
                use it again after a long period of time, they either remember how to utilize it or are reminded after a very short period of time.

        <h2><strong>Wireframing</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Our team created wireframes to help us determine what visual components are needed and where in the interface they would excel in performance, build the aesthetic foundations, and contribute to the usability of the system.
          <br/>We used these wireframes to collaboratively make design decisions that became the foundation for the UI designs crafted later in the project.

                A directory map wouldn’t be complete without having a point of reference and a path line that directs it to a specific destination. We wanted to make sure that the digital version of the directory map reflects the actual structure of the floor level.

              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Minimal Steps to Desired Results</span>
                We decided to limit the number of page navigations so that users aren’t required to perform multiple commands to get to their desired results. We wanted to ensure that a user could make a single request to acquire all the information they need.
                <br/>This also meant that the interface design needed to be as minimalistic as possible to prevent users from being overloaded with information.

          extremely happy with our integration of a user interface because it improved the overall usability of the system.</p>

              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Personality is Everything</span>
                I've learned that it is important for any kind of website to have a visual focus that users can easily familiarize with.
                To achieve this, the designer's responsibility is:
                <ul>
                  <li>to incorporate a high level of consistency and uniformity on all visual components</li>
                  <li>to use color, typography, and imagery effectively so that they compliment one another rather than create distractions</li>
                  <li>to grant key elements or content types their own exclusive visual identity.
                    This can help users make distinctions between different types of content.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-item-main"><span class="list-title">Overlooking the Entire Website is Important</span>
                It is easy to just get started designing page by page without addressing the entire scope of a site.
                However, I've learned that it is important to first take a step back and visualize how pages
                are connected with one another in the hierarchy - an understanding that is ultimately reflected on how the pages will be designed.
              </li>

                It was a challenging task for me to limit my tendencies to 'overdesign'.
                Because I didn't start the project with a completely empty canvas, I had to be able to utilize the peak of my creativity strictly within the constraints of an already-established concept (presented as the homepage for this project).
                <br/>This was quite a learning curve for me because I always had the tendency to over-populate a website with several features to the point where the aesthetics became very 'busy'.
                I've realized that that's where the website loses it's personality - it tries to be everything it's not, rather than be one thing that it is.
